This is unfinished but it has all the code we need



TODOS:

Sort out the camera lens/zoom/perspective handling better, it's very manual right now but it's hard to avoid at the moment. In general we need to automate the camera perspective stuff as much as possible 

(e.g. tracking the spectrum width so we can auto-zoom and set an x-axis using some kind of calibration step e.g. color filter paper for 1 or 2 specific wavelengths to track the x-axis onto.)

Fixing quaternion perspective stuff so we have the correct relative starting point (vertical lines)
